Developers <b>WASTE</b> way too much <b>TIME</b>
<smaller>by focusing on tasks which can be automated</smaller>

<b>Delegate</b> all that boring stuff <b>to PHPMate</b>.
I am here to bring <b>effectivity & productivity</b> back to your team!


Allow developers to focus on what truly matters - business solutions, and leave the rest to me.
All I want is to make developers happy!
