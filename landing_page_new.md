Developers <b>waste</b> way too much <b>time</b><br>
<small>by focusing on tasks which <b>can be automated</b></small>

<b>Delegate</b> all that boring stuff <b>to PHPMate</b>.<br>
I am here to bring <b>effectivity & productivity</b> back to your team!


Allow developers to focus on what truly matters - business solutions, and leave the rest to me.<br>
All I want is to make developers happy!

## How it works?

Flow is exactly the same as with your human colleague:

- You tell me what to do 
- I do it on a regular basis
- I open merge request
- You Review & Merge and enjoy your spare time <3

You can either choose from predefined recipes from the cookbook and/or define custom tasks yourself.

### Cookbook

Choose from many predefined <b>recipes</b> maintained by the community.

Recipes in Cookbook are focused on (but not limited to)  <b>improving code quality and decreasing the technical debt</b>.

Here is just a little sneak peek of limitless possibilities with me:

- Fix coding standards issues
- Remove dead code
- Update dependencies
- Add missing and fix incorrect type hints
- Update PHP version & features
- Generate various reports
- <small>... and many more, not only code quality focused ready-to-use recipes ...</small>


### Custom tasks

Maybe you need something custom, something very special. <b>Custom tasks</b> are here for you!

Do you have bash scripts? PHP? Python? JavaScript? Go? Docker command?<br>
Anything, that can run in a command line, can be a task I will run for you.

If the run results into code changes, I will open merge request for you.
