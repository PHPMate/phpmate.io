Developers <b>WASTE</b> way too much <b>TIME</b>
<smaller>by focusing on tasks which can be automated</smaller>

<b>Delegate</b> all that boring stuff <b>to PHPMate</b>.
I am here to bring <b>effectivity & productivity</b> back to your team!


Allow developers to focus on what truly matters - business solutions, and leave the rest to me.
All I want is to make developers happy!

## How it works?

Flow is exactly the same as with your human colleague:

- You tell me what to do 
- I do it on a regular basis
- I open merge request
- You Review & Merge and enjoy your spare time <3

You can either choose from predefined recipes from the cookbook and/or define custom tasks yourself.

### Cookbook

Choose from predefined <b>recipes</b> maintained by the community.

Here is just a little sneak peek of what is possible with me:

- Coding Standards
- Code Quality to decrease technical debt
- Composer dependencies updates
- PHP version updates
- ... and much more ...

### Custom jobs

You can define tasks on your own. <todo, need more text>
